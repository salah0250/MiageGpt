It integrates advanced features such as image recognition, voice assistant, and speech synthesis to meet the varied needs of its users.

  To enrich the user experience, MiageGPT offers speech synthesis that converts text into audible speech. This enables smooth and accessible bidirectional interaction.

- **MIAGE Assistant:**
  MiageGPT also serves as a dedicated assistant for MIAGE Nice Sophia Antipolis. It can provide detailed information about study programs, admission procedures, career prospects, and more. Users can ask specific questions about MIAGE and receive accurate answers through integration with the OpenAI API.
