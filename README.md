# MiageGPT

MiageGPT is an innovative project designed to provide an interactive experience based on artificial intelligence. This versatile system acts both as an interactive chat and as an assistant dedicated to MIAGE Nice Sophia Antipolis. It integrates advanced features such as image recognition, voice assistant, and speech synthesis to meet the varied needs of its users.

## Key Implemented Features:

- **Image Recognition:**
  MiageGPT can recognize images based on user-provided descriptions. It uses the DALL-E API to generate images in response to specific queries.

- **Voice Assistant:**
  The built-in voice assistant allows users to interact with the system using their voice. This feature uses speech recognition to transcribe speech into text, providing an intuitive alternative interface.

- **Speech Synthesis:**
  To enrich the user experience, MiageGPT offers speech synthesis that converts text into audible speech. This enables smooth and accessible bidirectional interaction.

- **MIAGE Assistant:**
  MiageGPT also serves as a dedicated assistant for MIAGE Nice Sophia Antipolis. It can provide detailed information about study programs, admission procedures, career prospects, and more. Users can ask specific questions about MIAGE and receive accurate answers through integration with the OpenAI API.

## Other Features:

- **Textual Interaction:**
  In addition to image and voice capabilities, MiageGPT supports standard textual interactions. Users can ask questions, get information about MIAGE Nice Sophia Antipolis, and explore various academic and professional topics.

- **Conversation Management:**
  The system supports managing past conversations, with the ability to create new chats, switch between them, and delete previous conversations.

## Technologies Used:

MiageGPT is built with modern web technologies, including HTML and CSS for the user interface, JavaScript for client-side logic, and Node.js with Express for the backend. It integrates OpenAI APIs for text and image generation, offering advanced natural language processing and computer vision capabilities.
